Reading increases our linguistic skills. The more we read, the more vocabulary we're exposed to. This helps us become more articulate whether we're speaking face to face with others or writing our thoughts down on a page. The more facts, situations, vocabulary, and perspectives we come across, the smarter we become. Learning to read is about listening and understanding as well as working out what is printed on the page. Through hearing stories, children are exposed to a wide range of words. This helps them build their own vocabulary and improve their understanding when they listen, which is vital as they start to read. </p>
